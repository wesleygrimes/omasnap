/** @fileoverview Manual scroll capture: an overlay that dims the screen around
 *  a chosen region, lets the user scroll the page beneath it, grabs a frame
 *  per scroll step through the live output-capture session, and stitches them
 *  into one tall image with the pure stitcher. Ties together the keyboard-
 *  interactivity zone, ext-image-copy-capture output capture, and stitch.hpp.
 *  The capture loop (grab → crop → classify → accumulate) runs on a worker
 *  thread so the overlay stays responsive. In manual mode small movements
 *  are held as a replaceable pending frame until they grow
 *  past a threshold, ambiguous small motion is recovered with a bounded
 *  re-search, the direction locks on the first committed band, and a frame
 *  that cannot be aligned keeps the last verified reference and warns instead
 *  of silently continuing. */
