# Omasnap

A native Wayland screenshot and annotation overlay designed for Omarchy and Hyprland.
It captures the focused monitor before mapping an exclusive layer-shell surface, so the
editor never appears in its own screenshot. The editor retains annotations as movable,
resizable vector layers and preserves the monitor's native pixels on scaled displays.

## Features

- Freeform region, window, and full-monitor capture modes.
- A pointer-side readout that turns any drag into a ruler: the pointer position
  while the crosshair is idle, then the frame size in native export pixels while a
  region, a hovered window, or a crop handle is being sized.
- Window capture is a crop of the focused-monitor frame. Overlapping windows stay
  visible; there is no second clean-window recapture.
- Select/move/resize layers, mouse-wheel scaling, and eight external recropping handles.
- Draw, type, resize, or carry a layer past the screenshot edge to grow the canvas.
  Framed growth is the default; `G` cycles to tight Overflow growth (only the
  sides needed by annotations, with no frame), then Image (the original canvas
  size, clipping every outside annotation). `Shift+G` cycles backward without
  changing layer geometry. New framed strips start in window gray with the
  original screenshot's card shadow. `B` cycles through the colorful backdrops,
  shadowed and flat window gray, and Off so a background can always be removed.
  Overflow with no backdrop leaves its added pixels transparent. `Shift+B`
  toggles the current shadow directly, and undo/delete can contract grown strips.
- Arrows, straight lines, smoothed freehand strokes, and translucent highlighter
  strokes that automatically match and stay straight across screenshot text (with
  freehand fallback), plus hollow or filled rectangles (optionally rounded) and
  ellipses, numbered markers, editable text in Neucha, JetBrains Mono, or Inter
  Display (plain, outlined, or on a readability pill), and secure redaction with
  opaque or randomized non-spatial mosaic output.
- Per-layer preset or custom colors (including highlighter ink), undo/redo history,
  one-click whole-image or drag-region OCR (the recognized text is shown beside
  the image and copied to the clipboard),
  mesh-gradient backdrops, and rendered drop shadows on standard backdrop cards.
- Cut tool: drag across a band of the image to remove it and collapse the gap, with a
  live preview and dashed seam marker while dragging; annotations shift to follow.
- Pin a finished capture as a bottom-right always-on-top layer surface, launched
  from the same `omasnap` executable and visible on every workspace.
- Crash-resistant working documents under `/run/user/<UID>/omasnap/` (falling back to
  a private `/tmp/omasnap-<UID>/`): the original source image plus a sidecar JSON
  operation log. Undo still works after a crash or `--file` reopen. Saving and
  copying write a normal flattened PNG to the clipboard or `~/Pictures/Screenshots`.
- Verified PNG clipboard output through `wl-copy`/`wl-paste`, plus timestamped files
  under `~/Pictures/Screenshots` by default.
- Open an image already on the clipboard directly in the annotation editor.
- A recents shelf: the select overlay stacks small cards of the last five captures
  along the right edge; hover to fan them out, click one to reopen it in the editor
  with its layers still editable instead of taking a new screenshot.
- Correct native-pixel export on fractional or integer-scaled monitors.

## Platform scope

The supported target is **Wayland + Hyprland**, with Omarchy as the primary integration.
The renderer, layer surface, clipboard, and monitor capture use Wayland protocols;
monitor/window discovery currently calls `hyprctl`. The focused output is captured
in-process through `ext-image-copy-capture` before the layer maps. Selection displays
that captured frame, while the annotation editor uses
a translucent layer scrim over the live desktop and draws only the selected capture.
Another Wayland compositor could support the application after supplying equivalent
monitor and window discovery; generic Wayland support is not claimed by 1.0.

Runtime commands used by the application:

- `hyprctl`
- `wl-copy` and `wl-paste`
- `tesseract`
- `omarchy-notification-send` when available; saved captures include a thumbnail and
  reopen in Omasnap when clicked. Notification failure does not invalidate output.

## Install on Omarchy

Clone the repository and run the Omarchy installer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tobi/omasnap.git
cd omasnap
./install-omarchy
```

The installer uses Omarchy's package helper for missing dependencies, builds in
`~/.cache/omasnap`, and installs under `~/.local`. It does not modify
Hyprland configuration.

### Hyprland binding

Paste this into a Lua config loaded after `require("default.hypr.omarchy")`:

```lua
hl.unbind("PRINT")
hl.unbind("F12")
hl.unbind("ALT + SHIFT + 4")

o.bind("PRINT", "Screenshot", "omasnap")
o.bind("F12", "Screenshot", "omasnap")
o.bind("ALT + SHIFT + 4", "Screenshot", "omasnap")

hl.layer_rule({
  match = { namespace = "^omasnap$" },
  no_anim = true,
  animation = "none",
  no_screen_share = true,
})
```

Each of these keys toggles: the first press opens the overlay, the next press dismisses it.

Apply and verify:

```bash
hyprctl reload
hyprctl configerrors
hyprctl binds -j | jq -c \
  '[.[] | select(.description == "Screenshot") | {modmask,key,description}]'
```

`omarchy plugin add` is intentionally not used. Omarchy plugins are Quickshell QML
extensions; they do not install native executables or system packages.

Set `OMASNAP_PREFIX` before running `install-omarchy` to use a prefix other than
`~/.local`.

### Manual Arch Linux build

Install the complete build/runtime dependency set:

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed \
  base-devel cmake ninja pkgconf qt6-base layer-shell-qt \
  wayland wayland-protocols hyprland wl-clipboard \
  tesseract tesseract-data-eng
```

Build and install:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$HOME/.local"
cmake --build build --parallel
cmake --install build
```

The install step places:

- `~/.local/bin/omasnap`
- `~/.local/share/applications/omasnap.desktop`
- `~/.local/share/licenses/omasnap/Neucha-OFL.txt`
- `~/.local/share/licenses/omasnap/JetBrainsMono-OFL.txt`
- `~/.local/share/licenses/omasnap/Inter-OFL.txt`

Ensure `~/.local/bin` is on `PATH`, then verify the installed CLI:

```bash
omasnap --version
omasnap --help
```

## CLI capture modes

Running without arguments opens freeform region selection:

```bash
omasnap
```

Explicit starting modes:

```bash
omasnap --capture-region
omasnap --capture-window
omasnap --capture-fullscreen
```

Scroll capture stitches a region that is taller (or wider) than the screen:

```bash
omasnap --scroll
```

Drag a region, then pick a direction: **Scroll ↓ / →** scrolls the page
yourself while omasnap captures each step, and **Auto ↓ / →** scrolls it for
you, one acknowledged notch at a time, stopping when the page stops moving.
The frames are aligned and stitched into one image and opened in the editor,
where `Ctrl`+wheel zooms and the wheel scrolls it.

Compatibility positional names are also accepted:

```bash
omasnap region
omasnap windows
omasnap fullscreen
omasnap smart       # maps to region selection
```

These options choose what is initially selected; the editor still controls whether the
result is copied, saved, or both.

Quick output skips the annotation editor. Add `--copy` to copy only, `--save` to save
only, or both flags to copy and save. Region and window captures output after selection;
fullscreen captures output immediately. Quick output cannot be combined with `--file`,
`--clipboard`, or `--pin`.

### One instance, toggled by the same hotkey

Only one capture overlay runs at a time, guarded by a lock file in the runtime snapshot
directory. Starting omasnap while an overlay is open sends the running instance `SIGTERM`,
which it handles with a clean Qt shutdown; the new process then exits without capturing.
Pressing `PRINT` therefore opens the overlay and pressing it again dismisses it.

Every capture invocation dismisses this way, quick output included: `--copy`/`--save`
while an overlay is open closes the overlay and outputs nothing, rather than screenshotting
the overlay that is still on screen.

Editing an existing image is never cancelled this way: `--file`, `--clipboard`, or an
image path stops the running instance, waits up to two seconds for the lock, and opens the
editor on that image. That is how a pin's Edit button and a notification click always land
in the editor.

A lock left behind by a crashed instance is removed and reclaimed. A lock file that cannot
be read or written at all is reported on stderr instead of being mistaken for a running
instance.

Exit codes:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Success, including dismissing a running overlay |
| `1` | Capture, image, or single-instance lock failure |
| `2` | Usage error |

### Edit an existing or clipboard image

Point omasnap at any readable image and it opens straight into the annotation editor
with the whole image selected, skipping the screen-capture step:

```bash
omasnap ~/Pictures/Screenshots/screenshot-2026-08-11_10-00-00.png
# or
omasnap --file /path/to/capture.png
```

To open the image currently on the Wayland clipboard:

```bash
omasnap --clipboard
```

The clipboard must offer readable image data. Text-only clipboard contents return an
error instead of opening an empty editor.

File URLs are accepted too. A saved capture notification's "Click to edit" action launches
`omasnap` on the finished screenshot, so it can be reopened and re-annotated.

### Recent captures

Every capture finished from the editor (copied, saved, or both) keeps its working
document, source plus operation log, on a shelf of the five most recent under
`~/.local/state/omasnap/recent/` (`OMASNAP_RECENT_DIR` overrides). The select
overlay shows them as a small stack of cards on the right; hovering fans them out
and clicking one reopens that capture in the editor, undo history intact, in place
of a new screenshot. Finishing a reopened capture replaces its shelf entry.

### Configuration (optional)

Omasnap has no settings UI and runs fine with no config at all. If you want to
change where screenshots land or what they are called, create
`~/.config/omasnap/omasnap.conf` (INI format); every key is optional:

```ini
[output]
# Where saved screenshots go. Default: ~/Pictures/Screenshots
directory = ~/Pictures/Captures
# Filename pattern, without extension (.png is appended).
# Default: screenshot-{date}_{time}-{app}
filename = screenshot-{date}_{time}-{app}

[colors]
# Up to eight preset colors for the palette, and the initial custom color.
palette = #ff375f, #ff9f0a, #ffd60a, #30d158, #0a84ff, #bf5af2, #000000, #ffffff
custom = #ff375f

[background]
# An image used as a "Custom" backdrop. B (or the toolbar button) cycles
# through the four gradients, this image when readable, shadowed/flat window
# gray, and Off.
image = ~/Pictures/backdrops/desk.jpg
# Style a fresh capture starts with: none, off, slate, aurora, sunset, lagoon,
# violet, or custom. `none` still allows Framed canvas growth to add its
# automatic window-gray mat; `off` stays transparent. `custom` only takes
# effect once `image` above loads successfully.
default = custom

[display]
# Top cutout dodge for notched MacBook panels (Asahi / show_notch).
# auto (default): apply built-in sizes on known 14"/16" modes only.
# on: always use notch_width / notch_height (built-in defaults fill blanks).
# off: keep the centered capture-tab strip.
notch = auto
# Logical pixels. Optional; auto supplies defaults on known panels.
# notch_width = 185
# notch_height = 37
```

Filename tokens:

| Token | Expands to |
|---|---|
| `{date}` | `2026-08-23` (yyyy-MM-dd) |
| `{time}` | `14-05-09` (HH-mm-ss) |
| `{app}` | Slug of the app under the selection, e.g. `firefox`, `alacritty`, `nautilus` (from the Hyprland window class). Empty for fullscreen captures, file edits, and when nothing is known — the separator before or after it is dropped too, so the default pattern gives `screenshot-2026-08-23_14-05-09.png`. |

The default keeps the date first so the folder always sorts chronologically:
`screenshot-2026-08-23_14-05-09-firefox.png`. Anything else in the pattern is
literal text (`screenshot-` is just a string). A name that already exists
gets `-2`, `-3`, … appended.

Environment overrides (`OMASNAP_SCREENSHOT_DIR` takes precedence over the config):

```bash
OMASNAP_SCREENSHOT_DIR="$HOME/Pictures/Captures" omasnap
OMASNAP_OCR_LANGS="eng+deu" omasnap
# Thai plus English:
OMASNAP_OCR_LANGS="tha+eng" omasnap
```

Install the corresponding Tesseract language data before adding a language to
`OMASNAP_OCR_LANGS`. When unset, omasnap falls back to Omarchy's
`OMARCHY_OCR_LANGS` (which commonly includes the user's script, e.g.
`tha+eng`), then to `eng`.

## Controls

### Capture selection

Tabs across the top of the overlay switch the capture kind: **Region**,
**Window**, **Scrolling Region**, **Fullscreen**. All four are modes of the
same overlay. Scrolling Region selects exactly like Region; once the region is
drawn, the page inside it goes live and the scroll controls appear in place.
Region and Scrolling Region frame the same rectangle, so switching between the
two keeps it: the frame drawn for a scrolling capture is captured as a region,
and a region just captured frames the scroll panel. Window and Fullscreen pick
an area of their own, so switching to either starts over.
The tabs stay up in the editor too: a tab there drops the edit and goes back to
capturing in that mode, and a small **Scroll capture** button under the image
turns the drawn region into a scrolling capture. The keys below do the same
without reaching for the pointer.

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| Drag | Select a region, with its native pixel size shown at the pointer |
| `Space` | Step through the capture-kind tabs (Region, Window, Scrolling Region) |
| `S` | Toggle scrolling-region mode |
| `R` | Restore the last region drawn this session (same monitor) |
| `SUPER + Arrow` | Move among windows in window mode |
| `Enter` | Capture the highlighted window |
| `Ctrl+A` | Select the full focused monitor (the Fullscreen tab) |
| Hover the right-edge stack | Fan out the five most recent captures; click one to reopen it |
| `Esc` | Dismiss (while selecting; in the editor, `Esc` returns to Select and a second `Esc` closes) |

### Annotation editor

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| `V` | Select/move/resize layers; carrying one past the source grows the canvas; drag empty canvas for a marquee; multi-select outlines each layer without treating the canvas as one layer; wheel scales the selected layer |
| `A` | Arrow |
| `S` | Spotlight/loupe; press again to cycle ellipse, rectangle, rounded |
| `L` | Straight line |
| `F` | Freehand stroke |
| `H` | Highlighter; Snap mode uses a mouse-following I-beam at the nearby text height, then locks the drag straight to that row. Press `H` again (or click the active toolbar button) for Normal freehand mode, where wheel or `Alt`+wheel changes thickness; Snap keeps detected-row height automatic and wheel sets only its off-text fallback |
| `I` | Eyedropper in the color popover · sample the image as the custom color |
| `C` | Numbered marker |
| `R` | Rectangle; hover the shape button for rectangle, ellipse, and fill controls; `Alt`+wheel rounds corners |
| `E` | Ellipse; shares the shape submenu and filled/hollow toggle |
| `D` | Redact; press again to toggle randomized pixelation or solid redaction |
| `X` | Cut out a band; drag to preview the crossed-out strip, then release to remove and collapse it |
| `T` | Text on a cream readability pill, with Neucha as the default. Click for a one-line label, or drag a box to give it room for several lines: Enter moves to the next line while there is room and commits on the last one; `Shift+Enter` always adds a line; `Esc` commits too but keeps the label selected, so `Backspace` removes it; clicking away keeps the text; press T again to toggle the pill |
| `Shift+T` | Cycle the next or selected text through Neucha, JetBrains Mono, and Inter Display |
| `O` | Recognize and copy all text in the current image |
| `B` | Cycle shadowed colors, window gray (shadowed and flat), and Off |
| `Shift+B` | Toggle the screenshot card's drop shadow; on by default |
| `G` / `Shift+G` | Cycle canvas boundaries forward/backward: Framed, Overflow, Image. Framed auto-grows with the normal frame; Overflow grows only the sides needed by annotations with no frame; Image clips at the original screenshot edge |
| `1`–`8` | Set annotation color; `7` is black and `8` is white |
| Wheel | Scale selected layer, magnify the spotlight under the cursor, or change active tool size (`Alt`+wheel: rectangle corner radius or spotlight border); while just viewing a zoomed capture, scroll it like a document |
| `Shift`+wheel | Scroll a zoomed capture sideways (a wide stitch); never changes the zoom |
| `Ctrl`+wheel · middle-drag | Zoom about the cursor · pan by dragging |
| `+` / `-` / `0` (also with `Ctrl`) | Zoom in / out / fit |
| Hold `Shift` while dragging | Make rectangles, ellipses, and spotlights 1:1; snap lines and arrows to 45°; while dragging a selected layer's handle, keep a rectangle, redaction or spotlight's aspect ratio (lines and arrows: 45°) |
| Hold `Alt` while dragging | Center rectangles, ellipses, and spotlights on the press point; add `Shift` for a centered square/circle |
| `←` `↑` `→` `↓` | Nudge the selected layer 1 px; hold `Shift` for 10 px (a held key is one undo step). With nothing selected, pan a zoomed capture |
| Double-click text · `Enter` on a selected text | Reopen text editing |
| `Delete` | Delete selected layer |
| `Alt+D` | Duplicate selected layer (offset down-left, or away from a nearby edge); the copy becomes the selection |
| `Ctrl+Z` | Undo |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Z`, `Ctrl+Y` | Redo |
| `Ctrl+C` | Copy PNG only |
| `Ctrl+S` | Save PNG only |
| `Enter` | Copy and save (with a text layer selected: edit it) |
| `P` | Pin the capture on screen and close the editor |
| `Esc` | Return to Select; press again to close |
| Right-click | Return to Select; cancel active drawing |

### Pinned captures

`P` renders the current capture, writes it to a `pin-<pid>-<n>-<random>.png` under
the runtime snapshot directory, and launches the same `omasnap` executable in
detached pin mode. Active pins stack from the bottom-right and can be dragged
by the image background. The layer stays visible on every workspace without
compositor window rules. It preserves the image
aspect ratio, with a maximum width of one third of the screen and a maximum height of one
half.

Pinning neither touches the clipboard nor writes to the screenshot directory; it is a
fourth output alongside copy, save, and copy-and-save. `P` closes the editor and releases
the single-instance lock immediately. Pins from separate captures accumulate as independent
processes.

Hover the pin to reveal its controls:

| Input on a pin | Action |
|---|---|
| Edit button | Reopen the full-resolution PNG in Omasnap and replace the pin |
| Link button | Copy the source file path |
| Copy button, `Ctrl+C` | Copy the full-resolution PNG |
| Double-wide top-left drag handle | Drag the PNG into a file-capable drop target |
| Wheel | Resize within the screen caps, preserving aspect ratio |
| Close button, `Esc`, middle-click | Close |

Image and path copying use `wl-copy` rather than `QClipboard`, so clipboard data remains
available after the pin is closed. No font-based symbol set or compositor-specific window
rule is required; the controls use the same vector icon renderer as the annotation toolbar.

Canvas boundary changes affect only preview and export clipping. The complete vector
geometry stays in the operation log, so switching back to Grow restores every off-canvas
part of a layer.

Creation tools return to Select after one placement without selecting the new layer. In
Select mode, arrows and lines show only their two endpoint handles; other layers show a
selection boundary. The eight blue/white handles outside the image recrop its corners or
edges. After the canvas grows, those crop handles remain on the original source frame.

## Development and verification

```bash
make check
```

The smoke executable exercises region/window/fullscreen startup modes, capture selection,
working-document persistence (source plus op-log JSON), annotation tools, undo/redo
replay, vector movement and scaling, text editing, OCR, native-DPI output,
endpoint-only line selection, annotation-driven canvas growth and clipping policies,
external crop handles,
and the native-pixel
measurement readout on a scaled monitor.

For live launch profiling, the binary has an opt-in millisecond trace from `main()`
through the first completed overlay paint:

```bash
OMASNAP_PROFILE_STARTUP=1 ./build/omasnap 2>startup.log
```

The trace also breaks native capture into Wayland registry, buffer allocation, frame wait,
and pixel handoff stages. It is completely silent by default.

`.github/workflows/build-linux.yml` runs the same `make check` build, interaction smoke,
and available static-analysis checks in an Arch Linux container, stages the CMake installation, and uploads a versioned Linux
artifact. A `v*` tag also attaches that artifact to the corresponding GitHub release.

## Acknowledgements

The capture and annotation workflow is inspired by three excellent screenshot tools:

- [Shottr](https://shottr.cc/) — fast region/window capture, OCR, and polished backdrops.
- [Satty](https://github.com/Satty-org/Satty) — a focused, Wayland-native annotation workflow.
- [Flameshot](https://github.com/flameshot-org/flameshot) — selection-first capture and an
  approachable annotation toolbar.

Thanks to their authors and contributors for establishing the interaction patterns that made
this project possible. Omasnap is an independent implementation and is not
affiliated with those projects.
